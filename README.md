# Beexy-UI

The library is under development and testing, so bugs could be relatively common. Used it under your responsibility.

Currently the library offers React Components on Three Categories:

* Iconographic
  * Background
  * Image
  * LinkIcon
  * RoundIcon
  * SvgIcon
* Layouts
  * Card
  * ResponsiveCardGrid
  * CenterLayout
  * VerticalLayout
  * HorizontalLayout
  * RelativeLayout
  * FloatingLayout
  * GridLayout1D
  * GridLayout2D
  * ItemGridLayout
  * LineSeparator
  * Frame
* Typography
  * Label
  * Title
  * Paragraph

More Components will be added in a Future.

A Website which explain how to use these Components is under development.
